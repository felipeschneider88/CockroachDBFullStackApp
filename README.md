# CockroachDBFullStackApp

## CockroachDB for Python Developers


In this course, you will build a full-stack ride-sharing application in Python using the popular SQLAlchemy ORM. You will start with a simple version that manages a fleet of scooters and their current positions. You will add features one by one as the course progresses until you have a highly functional application that is ready to track multiple vehicle types and users at scale.

* Along the way, you will learn how to:
* Deploy a free CockroachDB cluster on CockroachCloud
* Design your CockroachDB schema in SQL
* Model your data's schema in Python
* Perform transactions such as adding, removing, and updating rows
* Take advantage of CockroachDB's rich data types
* Optimize your queries with indexes for efficient filtering and sorting

Before taking this course, you should have experience with Python 3 and application development. It is helpful but not required to be familiar with SQL. If you’ve never used CockroachDB before, we would also suggest taking our “Getting Started with CockroachDB” course first.
